## How to See the Changes

### Step 1: Refresh Browser
Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** to hard refresh

### Step 2: Go to Projects Page

### Step 3: Verify
All project cards should now display:

## Consistent Layout

Now all projects will have the same layout:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Project Image     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Title               │
│ Description         │
│ [Tag] [Tag] [Tag]   │
│ [GitHub] [Live]     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## Image URLs

All images use this format:
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]?w=800&q=80
```
- `w=800` = 800px width (optimized for web)
- `q=80` = 80% quality (good balance of quality/size)
